# NeuroStol
NeuroStol is a publishing house, and a financial independent business that acts under its authority as a recognized member of [Research, Provisions, Successors, and the Member of the Broke Consortium](https://github.com/b-consortium).
We are a part of "One-Member Implementation", which means we do NOT accept publications from any entity or body which is not a part of the consortium nor act in facilitation of such entity.

NueroStol publishes media related to Broke Consortium and Broke Quarterly for now, while transparently considering other members for related media association in the form of press, publishing on our website, or using our distributors
to supply material. Each of our publication follows rigorous quality and text checks, with continous testing of our deployments and making our work generally accessible.

We are affiliated with the Broke Consortium, a research collective with a focus on open knowledge. While the consortium promotes open-source collaboration, NeuroStol works under a commercial model that allows us to maintain our operations 
and able's investment in new projects.
